You have pulled out more hairs than you have on your head, and now you realize that you haven't the slightest idea on how to prepare for your upcoming Amazon interview. Well, lucky for you, I've been there and done that! Here is the exact tools and methods I used to ace my Amazon Interview.</p>\n<h2>Interview Cake</h2>\n<p>This is the #1 resource I recommend for anyone who wants to learn their data structures. The website has readings for every data structure and concisely explains how, when and why to use each. <a href=\"https://www.interviewcake.com/\">Interview Cake</a> has a list of algorithm problems for each data structure. An IDE is available that can be used to solve the problems. If ever you get stuck on a question, there are a plethora of hints that are available to help get unstuck, just like in a real interview! Each problem is selected in such a way that it maximizes that amount you learn vs the amount of time you spend on it.</p>\n<h2>PRAMP</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://pramp.com/\">PRAMP</a> is a platform where you are matched with other developers also preparing for an interview. You take turns interviewing each other and then provide feedback. This platform is probably the biggest reason why I felt 100% comfortable during my interviews. After having done about 11 interviews on here, the real interviews felt no different.</p>\n<h2>Leetcode</h2>\n<p>Honestly, I attribute this the least to my success during the Amazon interview. Interview Cake and PRAMP together provided much more valuable practice. While using leetcode, I constantly ran into problems which needed just one small \"trick\" to be able to solve them. Real interview problems tend to test your ability to use different data structures and algorithms appropriately, not know some obscure trick. Regardless, filter by likes and submissions you'll find some decent practice problems.</p>","excerpt":"You've spent hundreds of hours becoming a great developer.
