In a world with so many JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, heck even Next, why Gatsby? Because none of those frameworks do what Gatsby does.

<h2>Speed, that's why!</h2>

Gatsby is a static website generator. Great! Wait, who cares? Well a lot of my clients and so will yours!

Being a static website has many benefits, one of which my clients have noticed is extremely quick load times. Or in the words of the Great Gatsby, **Blazing fast websites**. And this is not just some speed that you can achieve by compressing your images (though Gatsby does that for you too), these are speeds obtained by not having to hit a server and wait for your entire page to be rendered. So fast that even non techies have commented on the speed of <a title="ragith website" href="https://www.ragith.com" target="_blank">Ragith.com</a>

<h2>Something called GraphQL</h2>

Query your data, add it in your component and move on with your day. That's what I'm doing with this post.

GraphQL is great, query everything from a single endpoint. Move the complexities of manipulating data into queries and lastly, use only what you need not the 5000 pieces of useless information the random restaurant API forces you to fetch.

<h2>Family!</h2>

The Gatsby community is fantastic!

There are a plethora of plugins and API's avilable to be used. There's even hundreds of starter templates for you to choose from. Starting a Gatsby website is even easier than starting a basic HTML website.
